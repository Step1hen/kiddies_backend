# Purpose

Technology Considerations: For the backend framework, ExpressJS was evaluated. ExpressJS is well-established and offers more flexibility and large package access suitable for medium to larger applications. I choose NodeJS which is also a more lenient and easy to use technology which will speed up our development process while providing similar capabilities.

This is a node backend server for Kiddies Adventure Zone project. This will server APIs for the React frontend.

## Note

This can be adopted for use on library projects as well.
